For a Junior Certificate (JC) student in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), Geography topics like **Location, Drainage, and Rocks** typically aim to develop foundational knowledge and understanding of physical geography concepts, as well as the skills to interpret and analyze geographical data.

Here's a breakdown of what these topics usually include (objectives):

---

## Location

- **Understanding fundamental concepts:** Students should be able to define and understand concepts related to location, such as **latitude, longitude, grid references, scale, direction, and bearing**.
- **Map reading and interpretation:** A key objective is to enable students to read and interpret various types of maps (physical, population, weather, survey maps, atlases, large-scale plans). This includes:
  - Identifying and interpreting map symbols using a **key**.
  - Locating features using **4-figure and 6-figure grid references**.
  - Measuring distances on maps and converting them to ground distances.
  - Determining direction using a compass and **whole circle bearings**.
  - Understanding the relationship between map size and **scale**.
- **Developing a sense of place:** Students should develop an awareness of their own local, regional (Southern African Development Community - SADC), and global location.
- **Relating physical and human features:** Understanding how physical features influence human activities and vice versa in relation to location.

## Drainage

- **Understanding water bodies:** Students should be able to identify and describe different types of water bodies, such as **rivers, lakes, dams, and waterfalls**.
- **River systems:** Understanding the components of a river system (e.g., source, mouth, tributaries, drainage basin/catchment area) and the processes associated with them (**erosion, transportation, deposition**).
- **Drainage patterns:** Recognizing and describing different drainage patterns (e.g., dendritic, trellis, radial).
- **Importance of water resources:** Understanding the significance of drainage systems for human activities (e.g., agriculture, settlement, power generation, water supply) and the environment.
- **Water-related issues:** Being aware of problems related to water resources, such as **pollution, droughts, and floods**, and potential solutions.
- **Fieldwork and research skills:** Potentially, students might engage in basic research methods related to rivers (e.g., measuring speed, depth, and width).

## Rocks

- **Earth's structure:** Understanding the basic internal structure of the Earth, including its layers and their composition.
- **Types of rocks:** Identifying and classifying the three main types of rocks (**igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic**) based on their formation and characteristics.
- **Rock cycle:** Understanding the concept of the **rock cycle** and the processes involved in the formation and transformation of different rock types.
- **Formation of landforms:** Understanding how internal Earth movements (e.g., plate movements, folding) and external processes (e.g., weathering, erosion) lead to the formation of various landforms, often related to rock types.
- **Economic importance of rocks and minerals:** Understanding the uses of different rocks and minerals in daily life and their economic significance (e.g., for construction, energy, industries).
- **Mining and its impacts:** Being aware of the processes of mining and the associated environmental and social impacts.

Across all these topics, JC Geography aims to develop general geographical skills such as:

- **Knowledge with understanding:** Demonstrating factual knowledge and comprehension of geographical concepts, principles, and processes.
- **Analysis and interpretation:** Selecting, organizing, presenting, and interpreting geographical data from various sources (maps, diagrams, graphs, tables, photographs, written materials). This includes recognizing patterns, deducing relationships, and drawing conclusions.
- **Judgement and decision-making:** Making reasoned judgments and suggesting solutions to environmental and socio-economic challenges.
- **Investigation and evaluation:** Applying appropriate techniques for observing, collecting, classifying, presenting, analyzing, and interpreting geographical data.

The overall goal is to stimulate curiosity about the world, introduce students to people, places, and environments, and contribute to environmental awareness and education for sustainable development within the context of Eswatini, the SADC region, and the wider world.
